###**Executive Summary**

This project studies miles per gallon (mpg) performance of manual and automatic automobile tranmissions using exploritory data analyis and linear regression models.  The objective of this investigation is to statistically address the following two questions:

1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG
2. Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions

Based on these research techniques, the study concludes that manual transmissions are more fuel efficient than automatic transmissions by XX mpg

###**Data**
This project is based on data from the 1974 Motor Trend magazine.  It consists of  comprises fuel consumption data and 10 additional aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973-74 models).  A data description can be found at https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html.

###**Data Processing**
The mtcars dataset is found in the R package 'datasets'.  We therefore call the library datasets and load the mtcars set with the data() command.

```{r echo = FALSE}

#### Load package "datasets":
library(datasets)
#install.packages("corrplot")
library(corrplot) 

####Load data "mtcars":
data(mtcars)


```


###**Exploritory Data Analysis**
```{r, echo=FALSE }
str(mtcars)
summary(mtcars)
plot(mtcars)

M <- cor(mtcars) # get correlations

library('corrplot') #package corrplot
corrplot(M, type = 'lower' , method = "circle") 
corrplot(M, type = 'lower' , method = "number") 
cor(mtcars)

```

Initial impression of the correlation plot suggets the highly correlated variables to miles per gallon (mpg) include weight, displacement and number of cylinders all having a high negative correlation.  These are not independent effects however, as it is likely a close relationship between displacement and number of cylindsers for instance.  Relative to the question of manual v. automatic transmissions, some factors have a lower correlation such as quarter-mile time.  While we can take some initial guesses, for completness, we will first conduct regression anaylsis for all explanitory factors, then remove the factor with the least explanitory power until the remaining terms have a high degree of explanitory power and the residuals are both small in magnutide and in the aggregate.  We wil accomplpish this by removing all explanitory factors sequentially where p > 0.05 (testing at the 95% confidence interval)   

###**Regression Analysis**
```{r, echo=FALSE , message=FALSE , warning=FALSE}

fit1 <- lm(mpg ~ cyl + disp + hp + drat + wt + qsec + vs + am + gear + carb , data = mtcars)
summary(fit1)

```

First remove cylinders (cyl)
```{r, echo=FALSE , message=FALSE , warning=FALSE}

fit2 <- lm(mpg ~  disp + hp + drat + wt + qsec + vs + am + gear + carb , data = mtcars)
summary(fit2)

```

Now remove VS
```{r, echo=FALSE , message=FALSE , warning=FALSE}

fit3 <- lm(mpg ~   disp + hp + drat + wt + qsec + am + gear + carb , data = mtcars)
summary(fit3)

```

Carburetors is next (carb)
```{r, echo=FALSE , message=FALSE , warning=FALSE}

fit4 <- lm(mpg ~  disp + hp + drat + wt + qsec + am + gear  , data = mtcars)
summary(fit4)

```

Next number of forward gears (gear)
```{r, echo=FALSE , message=FALSE , warning=FALSE}

fit5 <- lm(mpg ~  disp + hp +  drat + wt + qsec + am  , data = mtcars)
summary(fit5)

```


Next rear axle ratio (drat)
```{r, echo=FALSE , message=FALSE , warning=FALSE}

fit6 <- lm(mpg ~  disp + hp + wt + qsec + am  , data = mtcars)
summary(fit6)

```

Next displacement (disp)
```{r, echo=FALSE , message=FALSE , warning=FALSE}

fit7 <- lm(mpg ~   hp + wt + qsec + am  , data = mtcars)
summary(fit7)

```

Next horsepower (hp)
```{r, echo=FALSE , message=FALSE , warning=FALSE}

fit7 <- lm(mpg ~ + wt + qsec + am  , data = mtcars)
summary(fit7)

```

Same thing using step
```{r, echo=FALSE , message=FALSE , warning=FALSE}

step(fit1 , direction = "backward")

```

plotting regression diagnostics
```{r, echo=FALSE , message=FALSE , warning=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(fit1)
```

Based on the regression analysis, we find the minimum adequate model to express mpg as a funtion of the remaining explanitory variantsin teh mtcars data set to be:

mpg = 9.618 + 2.936 * am + 1.226 * qsec - 3.917 wt

where:
  mpg is Miles / US gallon
  am is {1 if manual transmission and 0 if automatice transmission}
  qsec is quarter-mile time [seconds]
  wt is weight in [lb / 1000]

###**Conclusion**

Based on the linear model derrived in the regression analysis section, we condlide that:

1.  A manual transmission is better for mpg
2.  A manual transmission will deliver 1.226 mpg more than an automztic transmission all other things being equal.
