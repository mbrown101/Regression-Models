###**Executive Summary**
#####**Objective**
This project studies the effect of transmission type (manual or automatic) on automobile fuel efficiency (mpg) using  linear regression models.  The objective of this investigation is to statistically address the following two questions:

1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG  
2. Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions  

#####**Result**  
Based on an evaluation of three linear regression models using mtcars data, a model based on transmitttion type (am), weight (wt) and quarter-mile time (qsec) was selected as an optimal model.  Based on this 3-variable model, this study concludes:    
1. Manual transmissions are more fuel efficient than automatic transmissions   
2. Manual transmissions will deliver an average of 2.936 mpg better fuel efficiency than a like car with an automatic transmission   

#####**Data**
This project is based on data from the 1974 Motor Trend magazine and consisting various performance and design information  for 32 automobiles (1973-74 models). The data is further detailed here: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html

###**Exploritory Data Analysis**
#####**Identifying Relationships**
Plotting mpg v. transmission type (manual or automatic), we see that mean mpg of manual transmission cars is greater than the mean mpg of cars with automatic transmissions.   This provides some hope that we can find a relathionship between mpg and transmission type if not using a single variable, then with the employment of multiple variables.  To understand the explanitory variables that may account for mpg performance, we plot the correlation coefficients and find there are several relationships that may be of interest.  

```{r, echo=FALSE }
#str(mtcars)
#summary(mtcars)
#plot(mtcars)

par(mfrow=c(1,2) , cex = .75  )

boxplot(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$am , data = mtcars ,  
  col=(c("gold","blue")),
  main="MPG v. Transmission", xlab="Transmission [0 = automatic , 1 = manual]" , ylab = 'Miles per gallon' , 
  cex.lab = 1.2 )

M <- cor(mtcars) # get correlations

library('corrplot') #package corrplot
corrplot.mixed( M , main="Correlation of Explanitory Variables" , mar=c(0,0,4,0) ) 
#cor(mtcars)[1,]


```

#####**Analysis of Correlations**
The correlation plot indicates miles per gallon (mpg) is negatively correlated with several variables to include weight, displacement, horsepower and number of cylinders (all with values in excess of -0.75).  These are not independent effects however.  For example, there is a close positive correlation between number of cylinders, dispalcement and horsepower (greater that 0.75).  We would therefore expect that many of the variables will be removed from the linear model due to a high correlation with one another.  As variables are removed, we also expect to see certain of the remaining  variables become stronger contributors to the model. Note the correlation analysis was conducted prior to recastign certain variables to factors (e.g. VS, am)

###**Statistical Inference**  
#####**Two Sample t-test - Null Hypothesis: Manual and automatic transmissions yield the same mpg**
Before commencing regression analyis, it is useful to determine if transmission type has an effect on fuel efficiency as measured by mpg.  We shall use a two sample t-test to make this determination and evaluate at a 95% confidence interval, alpha = 0.05.

Ho = mpg [automatic] - mpg[manual] == 0 (there is no difference in mpg based on transmission type)  
Ha = mpg [automatic] - mpg[manual] < 0  (there is a difference in mpg based on transmission type)  

Based on a 95% confidence interval, the t-test below indicates we should reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternate hypothesis that mpg is indeed a function of transmission type. 

```{r, echo=FALSE }
mpg_manual <- subset(mtcars , am == 1)$mpg
mpg_auto <- subset(mtcars , am == 0)$mpg
t.test(mpg_manual , mpg_auto )

```

###**Regression Analysis**
#####**Transform Selected Variables to Factor Variables **
Since certain of the variables in the mtcars data set are factor variables, we recast the numeric data as factors.

```{r , warning=FALSE , message=FALSE , echo=TRUE}

mtcars$am <- as.factor(mtcars$am)
mtcars$vs <- as.factor(mtcars$vs)


```

#####**Single Variable Linear Regression  |  mpg ~ am**
We first examine a single explanitory variable transmission type (am) to see if there is a simple model that will address the question of effect of transmission on fuel efficiency.  The results of the single variable fit below show that the coefficient for am = 7.245 indicating a manual transmission will yield better fuel economy by 7.245 mpg than an automatic transmission all other things being equal.  The p-value of the single variable (am) = 0.000285 which is well below 0.05 (alpha = 0.05, CI = 0.95), we confirm the transmission type to be significant in this model.  Unfortunately, with an adjusted- R^2^ = 0.3385, the model leaves a good deal of mpg unexplained with equally dissatisfying residual values characterized by a standard error of 4.902.  A plot of residuals and a Q-Q plot can be found in the appendix.

```{r , warning=FALSE , message=FALSE , echo=FALSE}
simple_fit <- lm(mpg ~ am , data = mtcars)
summary(simple_fit)

```

#####**Multivariate Linear Regression with all Variables  |  mpg ~ .**
Constructing a regression model with all explanitory factors results in an adjusted-R^2^ = 0.8066 and a residual standard error of 2.65, a considerable improvement on the single variable model.  While the model explains mpg considerablly better than the single variable mode, there are several terms that are present but do not contribute substantially to the model and likely lower the adjusted-R^2^.  Specifically, there are several terms with a p-value > 0.05 further indicating they are misplaced in this model and subject to rejection at the 95% confidence interval, alpha = 0.05. A plot of residuals and a Q-Q plot can be found in the appendix.
```{r, echo=FALSE , message=FALSE , warning=FALSE}

fit1 <- lm(mpg ~ cyl + disp + hp + drat + wt + qsec + vs + am + gear + carb , data = mtcars)
summary(fit1)

```


#####**Minimum Viable Multivariate Linear Regression Model  |  mpg ~ wt + qsec + am**
Seeking a model with fewer variables, we use the step function which provides for the sequential removal of the least significant variable until a minimal model is achieved.  The output from the successive reductions are shown in the appendix.  The minimal viable model is attractive relative to the other two models in that it has fewer variables while explaining mpg to a greater degree based on an adjusted-R^2^ = 0.8336 and a reduced residual standard error = 2.459.  Furhter, each variable has a p-value well below 0.05 indicating strong significance. A plot of residuals and a Q-Q plot can be found in the appendix.

```{r, echo=FALSE , message=FALSE , warning=FALSE , results='hide' }

auto_fit <- lm(mpg ~ . , data = as.data.frame(mtcars))
auto_result <- step(auto_fit , direction = "backward")

```

```{r, echo=FALSE , message=FALSE , warning=FALSE}
summary(auto_result)

```

#####**Statistical Anslysis for Model Selection**

Form |R^2^ | Adj-R^2^   |  Res. Std. Err  |  am coeff 
-----|-----|------------|-----------------|----------
mpg ~ am  |0.3598 | 0.3385  |  4.902  | 7.245  
mpg ~ cyl + disp + hp + drat + wt + qsec + vs + am + gear + carb  | 0.869 |0.8066  |  2.65  | 2.520 
mpg ~ wt + qsec + am  | 0.8497 | 0.8336  | 2.459  | 2.9358 


Compairing the three linear models examined in this study, we select as the optimal model the three variable model (minimum viable) based on the having the highest explanitory power (highest adjusted R^2^ = .8336) and the  lowest residual standard error = 2.459.  The equation for the model is expressed below based on the coefficients and intercept extraced from the model summary:

mpg = 9.618 + 2.936 * am + 1.226 * qsec - 3.917 wt

where:  
  - mpg is Miles / US gallon   
  - am is {1 if manual transmission and 0 if automatice transmission}   
  - qsec is quarter-mile time [seconds]  
  - wt is weight in [lb / 1000]  
  
   
###**Conclusion**

Based on the linear model derrived in the regression analysis section, we condlude that:

1.  A manual transmission is better for mpg
2.  A manual transmission will deliver 2.936 mpg more than an automatic transmission all other things being equal.  


###**Appendix **
#####**Plotting regression diagnostics**  
Below, the residuals and the Q-Q plots are displayed for each model respectively (single variable, all variables, and minimum viable variables).  In each case the linear regression causes the resituals to populate approximately evenly about the fitted line and supports approximately normal distribution of the residuals as shown in the Q-Q plot.  It should be noted that even at high levels of explanitory power (using all variables and the minimal viable model), there are variations in mpg not explained by the variables in the linear model.
