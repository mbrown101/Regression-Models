### Question 1
### Consider the space shuttle data ?shuttle in the MASS library. 
### Consider modeling the use of the autolander as the outcome (variable name use). 
### Fit a logistic regression model with autolander (variable auto) use (labeled as "auto" 1) versus not (0) 
### as predicted by wind sign (variable wind). 
### Give the estimated odds ratio for autolander use comparing head winds, 
### labeled as "head" in the variable headwind (numerator)
### to tail winds (denominator).
library(MASS)
attach(shuttle)

head(shuttle)

logit <- glm(use ~ factor(wind) , data = shuttle , family = 'binomial')
summary(logit)

#recast as integers
shuttle$use <- as.character(shuttle$use)
shuttle$use[shuttle$use == 'auto'] <- 1 
shuttle$use[shuttle$use == 'noauto'] <- 0 
shuttle$use <- as.integer(shuttle$use)

logit <- glm(use ~ factor(wind) , data = shuttle , family = 'binomial')
summary(logit)
exp(logit$coeff)

# result for tailwind >> relevel for headwind
shuttle$wind <- relevel(shuttle$wind, ref = "tail")

logit <- glm(use ~ factor(wind) , data = shuttle , family = 'binomial')
summary(logit)
exp(logit$coeff)
### answer = 0.969


### Question 2
### Consider the previous problem. 
### Give the estimated odds ratio for autolander use comparing head winds (numerator) 
### to tail winds (denominator) adjusting for wind strength from the variable magn.
library(MASS)
attach(shuttle)

#recast as integers
shuttle$use <- as.character(shuttle$use)
shuttle$use[shuttle$use == 'auto'] <- 1 
shuttle$use[shuttle$use == 'noauto'] <- 0 
shuttle$use <- as.integer(shuttle$use)

# result for tailwind >> relevel for headwind
shuttle$wind <- relevel(shuttle$wind, ref = "tail")

logit <- glm(use ~ factor(wind) + magn , data = shuttle , family = 'binomial')
summary(logit)
exp(logit$coeff)
### answer = 0.969

### Question 3
### If you fit a logistic regression model to a binary variable, for example use of the autolander, 
### then fit a logistic regression model for one minus the outcome (not using the autolander) what happens to the coefficients?
### answer = The coefficients reverse their signs.


### Question 4
### Consider the insect spray data InsectSprays. 
### Fit a Poisson model using spray as a factor level. 
### Report the estimated relative rate comapring spray A (numerator) to spray B (denominator).

attach(InsectSprays)
logfit <- glm(count ~ spray - 1, family = 'poisson' , data = InsectSprays)
summary(logfit)
logfit$coef
ratio <- exp(logfit$coef[1]) / exp(logfit$coef[2])
ratio <- unname(ratio, force = FALSE))
print('relative rate spray A / spray B = ') ; ratio

### The long, ugly, non-R, non-GLM, non-sense way: 
bug_data <- as.data.frame(InsectSprays)
bug_a <- mean(subset(bug_data, bug_data[,2] == 'A')[,1])
bug_b <- mean(subset(bug_data, bug_data[,2] == 'B')[,1])
bug_a
bug_b
bug_a / bug_b
### answer = 0.9457

### Question 5
### Consider a Poisson glm with an offset, t. So, for example, a model of the form glm(count ~ x + offset(t), family = poisson) 
### where x is a factor variable comparing a treatment (1) to a control (0) and t is the natural log of a monitoring time. 
### What is impact of the coefficient for x if we fit the model glm(count ~ x + offset(t2), family = poisson) 
### where t2 <- log(10) + t? In other words, what happens to the coefficients if we change the units of the offset variable. 
### (Note, adding log(10) on the log scale is multiplying by 10 on the original scale.)
### answer = The coefficient estimate is divided by 10.


### Question 6 
### Using a knot point at 0, fit a linear model that looks like a hockey stick with two lines meeting at x=0. 
### Include an intercept term, x and the knot point term. 
### What is the estimated slope of the line after 0?

x <- -5:5
y <- c(5.12, 3.93, 2.67, 1.87, 0.52, 0.08, 0.93, 2.05, 2.54, 3.87, 4.97)
plot(x, y)
knots <- 0; 
splineTerms <- sapply(knots, function(knot) (x > knot) * (x - knot)) # create list where if x < knot, == o, else, == x
xMat <- cbind(1, x, splineTerms) # create matrix with i, x, splines
yhat <- predict(lm(y ~ xMat - 1))
plot(x, y, frame = FALSE, pch = 21, bg = "lightblue", cex = 2)
lines(x, yhat, col = "red", lwd = 2)
### answer = 1.013
